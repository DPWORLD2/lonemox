# 🚀 Lonemox VE – The Ultimate Virtualization Platform  

**Lonemox VE** is a cutting-edge, real-time virtualization platform designed to be **faster, more flexible, and more efficient** than Proxmox. It provides an intuitive **React-based UI**, real-time updates with **WebSockets**, and seamless resource management for **VMs and containers**.

## 🌟 Why Lonemox VE is Better than Proxmox  

✅ **Faster & More Efficient** – Built with modern web technologies, optimized for AMD/Intel GPUs, and uses Wayland for smoother performance.  
✅ **Full GUI with KDE** – Unlike Proxmox, which primarily uses a web interface, Lonemox VE offers a full-fledged GUI with KDE for a seamless desktop experience.  
✅ **Real-Time Updates** – Uses **WebSockets** to provide live status updates without refreshing the page.  
✅ **Enhanced GPU Support** – Optimized for **AMD/Intel GPUs** with **eGPU switching and automated tuning** for AI, gaming, and rendering.  
✅ **Better User Experience** – Clean, **dark-themed** UI, drag-and-drop resource allocation, and an **interactive dashboard**.  
✅ **Pre-Installed OS Templates** – Quickly deploy VMs with Ubuntu, Arch, Windows, and more.  
✅ **Offline Mode** – Full functionality without an internet connection, unlike Proxmox, which requires online dependencies.  
✅ **One-Command Installation** – Install effortlessly with a single command, supporting cloud and on-prem deployments.  
✅ **Live Resource Adjustments** – Modify CPU, RAM, and disk allocation on the fly without restarting the VM.  
✅ **Automatic Updates & Rollbacks** – Keeps your system updated with rollback options in case of issues.
